## Non-functional requirements üìÉ

| Characteristics     | Sub-Characteristics    | Requirements  | How to meet them |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:| :------:|
| Usability | Accessibility | As a user, I want a user-friendly design where each action can be done at most 5 clicks, so that I will not have trouble using it.| To do it, we can create a graph where each node is the web page or a pop-up window, and an edge is an action that happens when a user clicks on a button. Then we can apply the ‚ÄúFloyd‚ÄìWarshall‚Äù algorithm to find distances between each pair of nodes. Each distance must be at most 5.|
| Portability | Adaptability |As a user, I want to open the website on different devices which support Windows, Linux, macOS, Android or iOS, so it will be shown correctly taking into account my screen format and resolution.|To do it, we can resize a window with the website on the Chrome, Safari, Yandex Browser, Firefox or Opera browsers. Also, we can open the website on Android and iOS devices using emulators from Android Studio and Xcode IDEs.|
| Performance Efficiency | Time-behavior | As a student, I want to get the list of available tutors on the search web page for at most 5 seconds, so I will have the actual information.| To do it, we can measure the time after clicking on the search button which sends the GET request and stop the stopwatch when the server responds to this request and sends the JSON file|
|Reliability | Availability|As a user, I want to have 99% availability of the system, so most of the time I will get access to the website.| Analyze traffic and choose an appropriate hosting plan for such usage|
|Usability|Operability|As a user, I want to apply the filter search without reloading the webpage, so it shows me results dynamically.| Backend supports parameters in URL such as **subject**, **format**, **type** and **sorting**, so frontend automatically includes these parameters, according to what user selected in UI, and sends `GET` request to dynamically refresh the content. Users don't have to input anything in the URL and refresh a page.|
|Security |Confidentiality|As a user, I want to maintain my schedule privately, so no one will know what meetings I am attending|To do it, we use the Spring Security framework|
